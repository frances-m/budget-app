## Overview :ghost:

A minimalistic budgetting app with user authentication and persistent data. The user can enter in their monthly budget and the app will keep track of their total income and expenses. 

This app is a work in progress with many updates planned, so keep an eye out for new features!

## My process

### Built with

This was my first experience using Firebase! I've learned a ton about how to implement realtime databases and user authentication. Overall, I'm really proud of my implementation of these features and excited to continue delving deeper into these concepts.
